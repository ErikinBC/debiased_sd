    f"""
    Main standard deviation adjustment method to debias or reduce the bias. If sigma^2=E[X - E[X]]^2, then we are looking for an estimator, S, with the property E[S] = sigma. When S is the sample SD, then E[S] <= sigma, and we either adjust it with a scaling factor: E[S]*C_n = sigma, or a non-parametric bias shift: E[S + bias(X)] â‰ˆ sigma.  

    Args
    ====
    x: np.ndarray
        An array or array-like object of arbitrary dimension: x.shape = (d1, d2, ..., dk)
    method: str
        Which method should be used? Must be one of:
            vanilla: No adjustment
            loo: Leave-one-out jackknife
            bootstrap: Bootstrap
            gaussian: Known Gaussian C_n calculation
            kappa: First-order adjustment based on kurtosis
    axis: int | None = None
        Axis to calculate the SD over
    ddof: int = 1
        The degrees of freedom for the sample SD; should be kept to 1
    num_boot: int = 1000
        If method=='bootstrap', how many bootstrap sample to draw? Note that this approach will broadcast the original array with an addition {num_boot} rows in the axis=-1 dimension, so keep that in mind for memorary consideration
    random_state: int | None = None
        Reproducability seed for the bootstrap method
    **kwargs
        Optional arguments to pass into methods, see utils.sd_{method} for additional details
    
    Returns
    =======
    If x.shape = (d1, d2, ..., dk), and axis=j, then returns a (d1, ..., dj-1, dj+1, ..., dk) array
